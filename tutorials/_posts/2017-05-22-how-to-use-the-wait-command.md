title: "How to use the wait command"
---
The `wait` command is a _subroutine_, so you must call it like you would with a normal subroutine, i.e.

<br>

  `call wait1000ms`

  The microcontroller contains variations of this subroutine which all correspond to specific timings, 

`wait1ms`
`wait10ms`
`wait100ms`
`wait1000ms`
